Variable stars are some of the coolest celestial objects out there. They're endlessly applicable to the world of astronomy - but why is this?

## Topic Summary
A variable star is a star whose brightness as seen from Earth changes over time. It is easy to imagine stars as being static in their appearance - after all, our Sun doesn't appear to significantly change throughout the day, and the twinkling stars in the night sky *seem* to be unchanging each night. Yet variables are all around us; we must look a little bit closer to see how beautiful they really are.

At the same time, it can be difficult to imagine a star changing brightness, or to understand how they are important to astronomy. Variable stars aren't limited to stars that grow and shrink, however. Stars that are sometimes covered by other objects, stars that spin so fast that they turn elliptical in shape, stars covered in sunspots, even supernovae - all of these celestial oddities are considered variables. 

Variable stars can help us measure our place in the Universe, discover important characteristics about stars and how they grow, and could give us hints of possible exoplanets. I'll go a little bit more in-depth as to how useful they are!
