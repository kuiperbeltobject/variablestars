As we have grown more aware of variable stars, so too have we learned the usefulness of their properties. Perhaps most famously, Henrietta Swan-Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship of Classical Cepheid variables that allows us to determine our distance to various other stars. This is called the distance modulus, and it works as follows. Cepheid stars are very bright, young, metal-rich stars that have a unique characteristic: the brighter they are, the longer their period of pulsation will be. If we observe the same Cepheid star for a prolonged period of time, we can figure out its period, then use that to determine the star's distance from us based on its luminosity as we see it from Earth. Leavitt is probably the astronomer most associated with variable stars thanks to her work, and for good reason: to this day, Classical Cepheids are some of the most common ways for astronomers to measure distance. But astronomers of the past have found uses for the multitudes of other variable stars in the sky, too.

RR Lyrae variables also offer us a good look into distances across the galaxy and beyond. To determine distance using them, we usually observe the relationship between their period and COLOR, rather than their period and luminosity! but they have some other special traits that separate them from Cepheids. They're much dimmer and older, for one, but they are known to reside in globular clusters - circular, dense conglomerations of stars. In fact, over 80% of all variable stars found in globular clusters are RR Lyrae variables! They can help us better indentify these clusters of stars and determine the relative distance of many stars at once.

Astronomers have also been able to learn more about the nature of our Universe and the circumstances in which it was formed and continues to grow thanks to another kind of variable, Type 1a supernovae. These supernovae occur when a star orbiting another, smaller star (a white dwarf) begins to transfer its matter to the white dwarf. White dwarves only have a certain mass they can survive at - when they reach that critical mass, called the Chandrashekar Limit, they explode. Because this critical mass and its corresponding luminosity are known, we can determine just how far the supernova is from us, making it another example of a way to measure distance in space. By using the redshifts of these supernovae, astronomers found that the universe is actually expanding at a faster and faster rate!

But not all of the uses for variable stars are so far-reaching. They can also help us learn more about our own cosmic neighborhood! Take, for example, T Tauri stars. Notably, T Tauri stars are very young and big. They haven't gone on to become main sequence stars yet, so they're not as compact so as to start burning Hydrogen. Because of this, they're quite big! Though their variability is very erratic, T Tauri stars offer us some insights into how young stars behave, from the formation of little protoplanetary disks around them to their emission of X-Rays. We know our Sun passed through the T Tauri phase some 4 billion years ago, so looking at T Tauri stars is like looking into a time machine of our sun's infancy.
