As we have grown more aware of variable stars, so too have we learned the usefulness of their properties. Perhaps most famously, Henrietta Swan-Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship of Classical Cepheid variables that allows us to determine our distance to various other stars. This is called the distance modulus, and it works as follows. Cepheid stars are very bright, young, metal-rich stars that have a unique characteristic: the brighter they are, the longer their period of pulsation will be. If we observe the same Cepheid star for a prolonged period of time, we can figure out its period, then use that to determine the star's distance from us based on its luminosity as we see it from Earth. Leavitt is probably the astronomer most associated with variable stars thanks to her work, and for good reason: to this day, Classical Cepheids are some of the most common ways for astronomers to measure distance. But astronomers of the past have found uses for the multitudes of other variable stars in the sky, too.
