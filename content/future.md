The possibilities are truly limitless when it comes to variable stars and their variety. It's likely that, far into the future, variable stars would have helped us find hundreds of new planetary systems, some of which may be candidates for life. We may be able to gain a much deeper understanding of our universe thanks to the discoveries in cosmology that variable stars can help us make. We'll be able to refine our estimates of the age of the Universe as we further triangulate distances of objects from each other.

Most undeniably, the future brings possibly the most important item in astronomy - data. With months, years, decades, and centuries, we'll be able to collect millions of data points about all manner of celestial object, variable stars included. using this new information, we'll be able to refine our notions of the Universe and how it works - we'll be able to learn more about these variables, of course, but we'll be able to learn more about stars and how they evolve, the galaxy we live in and its neighbors, the existence and nature of dark matter and dark energy... not even the sky is the limit.

We've discussed how T Tauri stars can closely model how our solar system formed, so I find it best to close our discussion with an exploration of how variable stars can predict our Sun's aging. Mira variables are red giants rich in carbon or oxygen, and are far older than most variables. However, they can be thousands of times more luminous than the Sun is thanks to the envelope of gas that surrounds them. Over time, Mira variables slowly shed layers of their outer gas that surround them like a shroud. Compared to the shorter periods of other variables, Mira variables are known for having periods on the order of a hundred days or more. As a red giant, there is no doubt that Mira variables can help us augment our understanding of how our sun will behave in its later life.
